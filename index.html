        <h2>About Me:</h2>
              <p>Recently, I quit my job. Yeah terrifying right? In the middle of a global pandemic. I quit my job. I wasn't happy with where I was in life and how things were looking for me if I stayed on the same path. So here I am. Learning web design. Why? I enjoy doing this. If you enjoy what you do you will never work a day in your life.</p>
              <p>I went to Boces during high school and gradutated their program in Microcomputer Technology. In case you don't know, Boces is essentially a trade school that you can attend during your regular years of highschool and going there tought me a lot of general knowledge for computers and networks. I have completed some college majoring in Computer Information Systems. I plan to be going back to school and finishing that degree.</p>
