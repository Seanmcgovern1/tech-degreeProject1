        <h2>About Me:</h2>
          <p>I have completed some college courses in computer programming and I found myself very comfortable with coding and learning how to do it. I'm enjoying HTML and CSS a lot more than the C# that I was learning in the courses and I look forward to learning more about all the languages of web development.</p>
          <p>Also recently, I quit my job. Yeah terrifying right? In the middle of a <mark>global pandemic</mark> where millions of people are losing their jobs. I quit my job. I just wasn't happy with the career path that I was heading down. So in the mean time I am helping with the family business and learning web development. I want to pursue a career path that I actually enjoy doing and so far me and coding have been getting along pretty well, but I am only just getting started.</p>
